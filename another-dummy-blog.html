      <h3>Sub-heading One</h3>
      <p>
        The Hewlett-Packard Company, commonly shortened to Hewlett-Packard
        (/ÀàhjuÀêl…™t Ààp√¶k…ôrd/ HEW-lit PAK-…ôrd) or HP, was an American
        multinational information technology company headquartered in Palo Alto,
        California, that developed and provided a wide variety of hardware
        components, as well as software and related services to consumers, small
        and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and large enterprises, including
        customers in the government, health and education sectors. The company
        was founded in a one-car garage in Palo Alto, California, by Bill
        Hewlett and David Packard in 1939, and initially produced a line of
        electronic test and measurement equipment. The HP Garage at 367 Addison
        Avenue is now designated an official California Historical Landmark, and
        is marked with a plaque calling it the "Birthplace of 'Silicon Valley'".

        The company got its first big contract in 1938, providing its test and
        measurement instruments for production of Walt Disney's hugely
        successful animated film Fantasia. This success led Hewlett and Packard
        to formally establish their Hewlett-Packard Company on January 1, 1939.
        The company grew into a multinational corporation widely respected for
        its products, and its management style and culture known as the HP Way,
        which was adopted by other businesses worldwide. HP was the world's
        leading PC manufacturer from 2007 until the second quarter of 2013, when
        Lenovo moved ahead of HP. HP specialized in developing and manufacturing
        computing, data storage, and networking hardware, designing software and
        delivering services. Major product lines included personal computing
        devices, enterprise and industry standard servers, related storage
        devices, networking products, software and a diverse range of printers
        and other imaging products. HP directly marketed its products to
        households, small- to medium-sized businesses and enterprises as well as
        via online distribution, consumer-electronics and office-supply
        retailers, software partners and major technology vendors. HP also
        offered services and a consulting business for its products and partner
        products.

      <p>
        In 1999, Hewlett-Packard Company spun off its electronic and
        bio-analytical test and measurement instruments business as Agilent
        Technologies; HP retained focus on its later products, including
        computers and printers. It merged with Compaq in 2002, and acquired EDS
        in 2008, leading to combined revenues of $118.4 billion that year and a
        Fortune 500 ranking of 9 in 2009. In November 2009, HP announced its
        acquisition of 3Com,4 with the deal closing on April 12, 2010.5 On April
        28, 2010, HP announced its buyout of Palm, Inc. for $1.2 billion.6 On
        September 2, 2010, HP won its bidding war for 3PAR with a $33 a share
        offer ($2.07 billion), which Dell declined to match.7

      <h3>Sub-heading Four</h3>
      <p>
        On November 1, 2015, the company spun off its enterprise products and
        services business Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Hewlett-Packard retained
        the personal computer and printer businesses and was renamed HP Inc.8
